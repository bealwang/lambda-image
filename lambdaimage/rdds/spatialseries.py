    Distributed collection of 1d array data with spatial coordinates.

    Backed by an RDD of key-value pairs where the
    key is a tuple identifying a spatial coordinate (e.g. x,y,z),

    Parameters
    ----------
    rdd : RDD of (tuple, array) pairs
        RDD containing the series data

    index : array-like or one-dimensional list
        Values must be unique, same length as the arrays in the input data.
        Defaults to arange(len(data)) if not provided.

    dims : Dimensions
        Specify the dimensions of the spatial coordinate keys (min, max, and count),
        can avoid computation if known in advance
